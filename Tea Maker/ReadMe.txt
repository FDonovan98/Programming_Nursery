**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD DUE TO TIME, MONEY, AND IMPRACTICALLITY**

This is a long term project with the end goal bein that I can order a mug of tea on an app, have a program control some hardware, probably using arduinos, that will make this mug of tea, and then recieve a notification on the app when it is ready.

So you know that project you did in Year 7 science on "How to make a mug of tea?" and you had to fill it out so make you think things through step by step? I'm basically doing that because I'm original and drink too much tea.


Stages:
0. Work out - how long tea takes to steep
    - how much milk is the correct amount

1. Design the hardware that will allow a mug of tea to be remotely created.

2. Create a program to run the hardware.

3. Design a basic app, capable of sending an order and recieving notifications from the program (Finished, error). Also update the program to make this possible


Step-by-step of making a mug of tea:
Stage 1 - The Supply Run
1.1 Check there are enough supplies (teabags, milk, sugar, mug, spoon) available.
1.2 Is there enough water in the kettle? If there is, turn the kettle on. If not, add water to kettle. 
1.2.1 How much water should be added? Could drain kettle completely so the same amount of water is always added, or have the water level sensor return the actually level and then calculate the amount needed instead of just returning enough or not enough
1.3 If there is a problem at this stage (not enough supplies) then notify the user

Stage 2 - The First Law Of Transmutation 
2.1 While the kettle boils place a mug into the summoning circle and add a tea bag
2.2 Once the kettle has boiled pour the right amount of boiling water into the mug (No way this can go wrong)
2.3 Add one sugar and the right amount of milk

Stage 3 - Transmutation
3.1 Wait enough time for the tea to steep to a good strength
3.2 Remove and dispose of the tea bag
3.2.1 It may be easier to make the tea not in the mug up to this point and then pour it into the mug at this stage through a mesh to catch the bag
3.3 Notify the user their tea is ready


Extensions (Of varying plausability):
Have the tea delivered to the user once it's been made. This would require the user to enter the room they were in and the robot, whose purpose is to pass the tea, to be able to navigate the house to individual rooms.

The program could notify the user when they started to run low on supplies (teabags, milk, sugar).

Allow the user to customise their order by changing the amount of sugar, milk, or steeping time. Could even allow other drinks
